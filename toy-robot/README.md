![Toy Robot App workflow](https://github.com/uvishere/toy-robot-challenge/actions/workflows/publish-app.yml/badge.svg)

*PS: I used a human because I couldn't find a proper emoji for a walking robot. Can someone please make one?? ðŸ¤–*

The app is generated using the Vite template for React. If you wish to learn more, [here's the link](https://vitejs.dev/guide/).

## How to Use
The application is GUI-based and asks for the initial placement of the robot. Once the initial placement is given, you can move the robot using the keyboard arrow keys. You can see the current position at the bottom of the board.
